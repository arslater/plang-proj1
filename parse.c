    /*
     * Okay, so the idea is, that the file gets parsed, line by line.
     * The goal of this is to use a state machine that is triggered by the presence
     * of the regular expressions. For example if given the follownig regex:
     *  abc*[123]
     *  The first thing that will be done is decide if the current character is a
     *  literal or a symbol( something that triggers a state) if it's a literal, save
     *  the literal in the string, literal, that is denoted in the struct.If the character
     *  is a special character, then, using the literal string, see how many it matches
     *  (( the matches are determined by the symbol. Then, look at the file( that is saved
     *  as an array of strings to see what matches. Going character by character, saving ( in
     *  an array, startOccurence, the start point and in another array, the endpoint, end
     *  occurrence. Once that is done for the entire line, the string is then re-examined
     *  using a loop that grabs the string in between the two indexes. Finaly, that string is
     *  then printed out and the loop continues for the next line until completion.
     *      1. Look at input file string
     *      2. Determine if the regex char is special or a literal
     *          a) literal? Add to 'literal' string, goto 2
     *          b) special?
     *              1) Is the present symbol ( from the last iter) special?
     *                  a) no: continue to 3
     *                  b) yes: continue to 3 with the string being the same
     *                     ** the only case where this is relevant is when you have [1234]*
     *                     or [1234]+ . So you can see if there are 0 or more of the characters
     *                     in the range or 1 or more of the charachtes in the range. --edgecase--
     *      3. Determine the character
     *          a) splat:
     *              1. Get literal String
     *              2. Get the string of first line
     *              3. Compare the literal string to character of line
     *              4. Does the line string equal ...
     *                  a) the literal string exactly (goto)
     *                  b) the literal string plus one or more of the last char
     *                  c) the literal string minus the last char
     *                  c) none of these
     *                 Repeat until end of line.
     *           b) plus:
     *               E. Is this an edge case?
     *               1. Get the literal string
     *               2. Get the string of the first line
     *               3. Compare the literal string to the string of line
     *               4. Does the line string equal...
     *                  a) the literal string exactly?
     *                  b) The literal string plus one or more of the last char
     *                  c) none of these
     *                 Repeat until the end of the line.
     *           c) braces
     *              1. Is this a '['
     *                  a) yes: goto 2
     *                  b) no: this is a ']' : goto 3c2
     *              2. Get the literal string ( stuff in brackets)
     *              3. Get the string of the first line
     *              4. Compare the literal string to the string of the first line
     *              5. Does the line string equal...
     *                  a) any single charachter of the literal string
     *                      1) yes: pattern found, move to next term
     *                      2) no, continue to the end of the line, comparing each
     *                         individual charachter in the input string to each literal
     *                         charachter that is within the literal string
